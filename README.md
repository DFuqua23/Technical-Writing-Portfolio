# Dominique Fuqua – Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome! 👋  
This repo showcases my technical writing samples.  

My background is in IT and cybersecurity, and I’m practicing technical writing.  
Here you’ll find documentation I’ve created on:  
- IT system setups (Ubuntu in VirtualBox)  
- ServiceNow workflows (incident tickets & catalogs)  
- Cybersecurity processes (incident response playbooks, packet analysis)  
- Structured authoring samples (DITA/XML, Markdown)  

## Currently Learning
- Practicing DITA using Oxygen XML  
- Exploring ServiceNow developer instance workflows  
- Expanding documentation samples weekly
